## ðŸ’– Contributing

If you want to update a rule file, you can create a pull request with your changes to `*.json` files. Do not change `*.min.json` files, since they are generated by minifying corresponding `*.json` file automatically.

If you want to add a new rule file, in addition to creating a new `*.json` file, you'll need to update `list.json` file to include the new rule file, and `README.md` to briefly introduce your rules. After your pull request is merged, the minified version of the new rule file will be generated automatically.
